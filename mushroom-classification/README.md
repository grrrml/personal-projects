# Mushroom classification project

This project is a classification problem. The goal is to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their features. The dataset used in this project is the [Mushroom Classification](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset contains 8124 instances and 23 features. The features are all categorical and the target variable is binary (either edible or poisonous).
